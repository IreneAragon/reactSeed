# This is a React Seed to start working on personal projects

For this React seed I'm using Webpack as bundler, you'll be able to work with SASS as well.
Please watch that this seed it doesn't have typescript installed, you can do it if you want or download my React and Typescript Seed that will come soon.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have nodejs installed in your computer, to know if you already have installed nodejs you can run on your terminal/console `node -v` or `npm -v`. If you have not installed you can do it [`here`](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Start working!

- Navigate to the folder where you download the repository and run `npm start`.

```
npm start
```
